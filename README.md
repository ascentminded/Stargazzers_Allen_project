# Machine learning Approach for calcium imaging!
this project is about using different machine learning techniques (Classic ML alghorithms, Deep learning, Ensemble learning, ...) in calcium imaganing data. \
</br>
Data that we used in this project is for Allen Institute Calcium imagig dataset that is about V1,SST and VIP interneurons. \

[this is our team project(Startgazzers) in NMA 2021 CN! hope you enjoy!] \

## Requirements
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* torch
* sklearn
## Notebooks
we used ML techniques to find meaningfull relationship between different Neural activity and stimuluses (Novel or Familiar Pictures!) \
so **we have 3 different notebook:**
* [Predicting Novility vs familiarity based on VIP cells](https://github.com/m-abdollahi/Stargazzers_Allen_project/tree/main/notebooks)
* [Predicting Novility vs familiarity based on SST cells](https://github.com/m-abdollahi/Stargazzers_Allen_project/tree/main/notebooks)
* [Predicting Rewarded vs Not Rewarded trials based on SST and VIP cells](https://github.com/m-abdollahi/Stargazzers_Allen_project/tree/main/notebooks)

**What about Our Machine learning techniques?** we used :

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Linead Discrimination Analyze
* Deep Neural Network
* Ensemble Models
