# Machine learning Approach in calcium imaging!
this project is about using different machine learning techniques (Classic ML alghorithms, Deep learning, Ensemble learning, ...) in calcium imaganing data. \
data that we have used in this project is for Allen Institute Calcium imagig dataset that is about V1,SST and VIP interneurons. \
